/*
    Method signature consists of method name followed by argument types.
    For ex:- public int m1(int i, float f){}

        Method sign for above method will be [m1(int,float)]

    In other programmin languages return type is also part of method signature but not in java.

    Who is going to use method signature ?
    Ans:- Compiler will use this method signatures while resolving method calls

    For every class compiler will maintain one table i.e method table


    Within a class Two methods with same signature is not acceptable in java evethoug the return type are different
