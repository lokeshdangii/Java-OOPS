/*
    Java wouldn't provide support for multiple inheritance because of the Ambuigity problem or Diamond access problem.

    But how java support multiple inheritance in Interface??
    In interface all the methods are abstract i.e only declaration no implementation


    Cyclic inheritance is not supported in any programming logic.
